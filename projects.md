### Planets

#### May 2015 - Present

Python object that can give the current right ascension, declination, azimuth, and elevation of the planets for any location on earth. Can also approximately calculate these parameters for Pluto. Uses algorithms/equations from ["How to Compute Planetary Positions"](http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html#20) by Paul Schlyter.

### Luna

#### April 2015 - Present

This python object can give the current azimuth and elevation of the moon for any location on earth between the years 1900-2100. I recently added a method for calculating moon rise and set times, but the algorithm still needs some work since the moon does not rise/set in a 24 hour period.

Adapted from [original code](http://www.stargazing.net/kepler/moon2.html) in QBASIC by Keith Burnett.

Further adatped with algorithms/equations from ["How to Compute Planetary Positions"](http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html#20) by Paul Schlyter.

### Wadokei

#### March 2015 - May 2015

This program uses python and tkinter to make a continuously updating wadokei for any location (not including the arctic and antarctic circles). Wadokei are an older form of Japanese clock, and are essentially mechanical sun dials. This means that the lengths of hours differ between night and day and change throughout the year. More information can be found on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_clock 

Concept for calculating sunrise and sunset from ["Calulating sunrise and sunset in Python"](http://michelanders.blogspot.com/2010/12/calulating-sunrise-and-sunset-in-python.html)â€‹ by Michele Anders.

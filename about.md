My name is Max Hirsh. I majored in Physics at the University of Oregon and graduated in June 2013. I like solving complex problems and have spent the past several months learning several programming languages through teamtreehouse, codeacademy and other online tutorials. I like how programming makes it possible to apply physics to build programs that do things like model the solar system, predict astronomical phenomena, or quickly solve problems that would take days to workout by hand.

I am a fan of Python and used it to program several astronomy related projects including a planetary position caclulator. I am currently working my way through more tutorials in Django so I can build APIs. Outside of python, I have also completed TeamTreehouse's full-stack javaScript course and am familiar jQuery and node.js.

My hobbies include running, jazz piano and learning Japanese. I currently work as a medical scribe in Vancouver, Washington. In my free time I also like to read up about the latest NASA missions or use my python apps for amateur astronomy.
